# PHIVOLCS Earthquake Tweet Scraper

This project is a Python-based web scraper that extracts recent earthquake-related tweets from the official PHIVOLCS-DOST Twitter/X account. It automates browser interactions using Selenium and parses tweet content using regular expressions to extract key earthquake details such as magnitude, depth, location, intensity, and date/time.
